# Sorting_Visualizer
The sorting visualizer will allow users to visualize different sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort , Merge Sort , Quick Sort) on an array of bars representing values and analysis their time complexity 
# Project Features
- Visualize Sorting Algorithms: Users can see how sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort work step-by-step.
- Interactive Controls: The application includes buttons to generate a new set of random bars, start sorting, and select different algorithms.
- Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to various screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Customizable Speed: Users can adjust the speed of the visualization to better understand the sorting process.

# Technologies Used
- HTML: Provides the structure of the application, including buttons, containers, and layout elements.
- CSS: Styles the visual elements, including the sorting bars and control buttons, and adds animations for transitions during sorting.
- JavaScript: Implements the sorting algorithms, controls the animation flow, and handles user interactions.
